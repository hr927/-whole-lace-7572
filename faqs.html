<button type="button" class="collapsible">Farfetch pricing & payment</button>
<div class="content">
  <h4>Why is Farfetch pricing special?</h4>
  <p>It's down to our unique business model. At Farfetch, you are shopping pieces from our luxury brands and partners worldwide, expertly curated for you by our team. Prices are determined by each Farfetch partner, so the price of the same item may vary depending on where it's coming from and your location. That's also why placing an item in your shopping bag or Wishlist won't reserve it at a particular price.</p>
  <p>Although we don’t have any control over price variation, we will always offer you the best price available to your destination at the time of purchase. To view the most accurate prices, select your delivery destination at the top left corner of our site.</p>
  <p>Please note: Placing an item in your shopping bag or wishlist does not reserve it at a particular price.</p>
  <h4>Which currencies can I shop in?</h4>
  <p>This is determined by your shipping destination and will be displayed at checkout before completing your purchase. If your local currency is unavailable, your order will be charged in USD for a competitive exchange rate.</p>
  <h4>When will my card be charged?</h4>
  <p>If you pay by debit card or PayPal, Farfetch will take payment at the point your order is placed on our site. If you pay by credit card, full payment is usually taken once your order is ready for shipping, but your bank or card issuer may reserve the order amount in your account immediately.</p>
